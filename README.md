**This repository contains all code files used in the quantitative analysis of survey data gaps in NEA bottom trawl surveys**

Scripts in this repository can be seperated in 2 groups: 
  1) quantitative analysis of survey effort (location and number of hauls completed) in relation to survey targets (as defined by survey protocol)
  2) modelling using a spatiotemporal GAM to evaluate the effect of storminess, time and space on survey effort
  3) qualitative review of IBTSWG reports

Scripts and data in group 1 are survey-specific: Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS), Irish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey (IAMS), and North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS). 
Scripts and data in group 2 apply to the IGFS only.
Script and data in group 3 apply to all surveys in the North Sea and Northeast-Atlantic by the IBTSWG
